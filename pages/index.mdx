## Overview of the Zenetics Platform

The Zenetics Platform is a cloud-based platform that provides a set of tools and services to help you build, evaluate, and iteratively improve applications with expert feedback. The platform is designed to help you build applications that are reliable, scalable, and secure.

The Zenetics Platform consists of the following components:
* **Zenetics SDK**: The Zenetics SDK for Python and Typescript provides you with an easy way to capture the input and output of your LLM models to identify problems with the generated results and to provide your team with all the relevant context to improve the reliability and test the generated output.
* **Zenetic Portal**: The Zenetics Portal scaleble application that allows your team of engineers, product managers and domain experts to collarboratively build and optimize reliable LLM applications. It provides access to the Session data captures by the LLM and provides intuitive features to evaluate, analyze and improve the generated output.
