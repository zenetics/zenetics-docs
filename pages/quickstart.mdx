# How to Get Started with Zenetics

Welcome to Zenetics! We're excited to have you here. This guide will help you get started with Zenetics and show you how to create your first project. The process is simple and will get you up and running with a first sample application in less then 10 minutes.

This quickstart guide will walk you through the necessary steps to evaluate the first output generated by your application in Zenetics. This guide assumes that you have an existing Zenetics account.

If you don't have an account yet, you can request a Zenetics Product Demo or join our Waiting List for the Pilot Program. To request a demo, book your personal demo with our team at [zenetics.io](https://www.zenetics.io/contact). To join our free pilot, please reach out to us at: sales@zenetics.io

<Steps>

### Install Zenetics SDK
 
`bash
pip install zenetics
`

For more information see the [Zenetics SDK documentation](/sdk/overview).
 
### Replace your LLM call with the Zenetics SDK

Import the Zenetics SDK in your application.

```python
from zenetics import openai
```

Replace the call to your LLM provider with respective method from the Zenetics SDK. This examples shows how to use the Zenetics SDK to generate a completion using OpenAI API for ChatGPT. The Zenetics methods support the exact same parameters as the original provider API.

```python
openai.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Knock knock."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Who's there?"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Orange."},
    ],
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
)
```

### Configure Zenetics SDK

The SDK requires credential to be provided via environment variables to prevent sensitive information to leak into source code. The following environment variables are required:

- `ZENETICS_API_KEY`: Zenetics API key
- `ZENETICS_APP_ID`: Zenetics application ID

Depending on your selected LLM provider, you must also provide the API key authenticating access to the provider's API. Zenetics does not access your providers API and does not read your provider API key.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key

For more information on how to access your application credentials, see the [Zenetics Application Setup](/portal/applications#application-setup).

### Run Your Application

Generate a first session by running your application. The Zenetics SDK will automatically create a new session and capture the data for you automatically

### Evaluate Session in Zenetics

Log into your Zenetics account: [app.zenetics.io](https://app.zenetics.io). If the configuration was successful, you should see a new session in your dashboard. Click on the session to view the generated output.
