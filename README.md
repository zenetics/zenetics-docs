# ZENETICS Docs

This project contains the pubic documentation of Zenetics: [docs.zenetics.io](https://docs.zenetics.io)

This project is based on [Nextra](https://nextra.site), a documentation framework based on NextJS. The [Nextra Docs](https://nextra.site/docs) provide additional information on how to add new pages and add content for pages. 

The project is a fork of [Nextra-Docs-Templates](https://github.com/shuding/nextra-docs-template).



## Local Development

### Dependencies

To build and run the project, a NodeJs installation (>= v19) is required. One option is to use the Node version manager: [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

The project requires the package manager [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to be installed: `npm install -g pnpm`

### Run locally

Then, run `pnpm dev` to start the development server and visit localhost:3000.

### Specific Content Components

Nextra is based on NextJS and therefore supports frontend components based on React to define specific types of content (e.g. Code Blocks, Tables, etc.). There is a list of predefined components that come with Nextra: [Build-in components](https://nextra.site/docs/guide/built-ins)

In addition, Nextra allows custom components to be defined. These will be locaed in the **components**-folder in this repository.
